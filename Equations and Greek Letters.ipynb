    "Jessica Nash from MolSSI created a small python file that makes using Greek letters in your output even easier. You simply need to have the file (greek_letters.py) in the same directory as your notebook and use an import command. When you want to insert a Greek letter, you just use greek.letter (for lower case) or greek.LETTER (for upper case). The example below demonstrates how you can use greek.mu to get the symbol for micro, as well as how to print lower and upper case versions of the Greek letter alpha."
