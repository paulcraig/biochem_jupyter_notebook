    "* Computation could be handy for some more advanced topics\n",
    "    * Structure-function relationships: how does changing pH change the function of a protein?\n",
    "    * Hemoglobin would be a great example for this\n",
    "* Plots are important and difficult to generate\n",
    "    * Hydropathy plots\n",
    "    * Plot of helical wheels with colors to indidate charge and polarity (even better in 3D)\n",
