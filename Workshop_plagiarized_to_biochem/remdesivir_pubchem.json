Like other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 depends on an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme complex for genomic replication, which can be inhibited by a class of drugs known as nucleoside analogues.  Remdesivir (GS-5734) is an adenosine triphosphate analogue first described in the literature in 2016 as a potential treatment for Ebola. Broad antiviral activity of remdesivir is suggested by its mechanism of action, and to date, it has demonstrated in vitro activity against the Arenaviridae, Flaviviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Coronaviridae viral families. Remdesivir activity against the Coronaviridae family was first demonstrated in 2017, leading to considerable interest in remdesivir as a possible treatment for COVID-19. Remdesivir was confirmed as a non-obligate chain terminator of RdRp from SARS-CoV-2 and the related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and has been investigated in multiple COVID-19 clinical trials.  Based on aggregate data, remdesivir was granted an FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on May 1st, 2020. The FDA subsequently granted full approval for remdesivir as a COVID-19 treatment on October 22, 2020, while simultaneously updating the EUA to cover those patients not included under the approved indication. Remdesivir is currently marketed under the trademark name VEKLURY® by Gilead Sciences Inc.  Remdesivir in combination with [baricitinib] for the treatment of COVID-19, was granted an FDA Emergency Use Authorization on 19 Novermber 2020.",

                      "String": "COVID-19 is caused by the positive-sense RNA virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Replication of the viral genome is a key step in the infectious cycle of RNA viruses, including those of the _Filoviridae_, _Paramyxoviridae_, _Pneumoviridae_, and _Coronaviridae_ families, and is carried out by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzymes or enzyme complexes.[A222393, A222398] For both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the RdRp comprises nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 subunits under physiological conditions, although functional RdRp complexes can be reassembled _in vitro_ that incorporate only the nsp8 and nsp12 subunits, similar to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).[A222398]  Remdesivir is a phosphoramidite prodrug of a 1'-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue that competes with ATP for incorporation into newly synthesized viral RNA by the corresponding RdRp complex.[A222398] Remdesivir enters cells before being cleaved to its monophosphate form through the action of either carboxylesterase 1 or cathepsin A; it is subsequently phosphorylated by undescribed kinases to yield its active triphosphate form remdesivir triphosphate (RDV-TP or GS-443902).[A222393, L18438] RDV-TP is efficiently incorporated by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex, with a 3.65-fold selectivity for RDV-TP over endogenous ATP.[A222398, L18438] Unlike some nucleoside analogues, remdesivir provides a free 3'-hydroxyl group that allows for continued chain elongation.[A222398, L18438] However, modelling and _in vitro_ experiments suggest that at _i_ + 4 (corresponding to the position for the incorporation of the fourth nucleotide following RDV-TP incorporation), the 1'-cyano group of remdesivir sterically clashes with Ser-861 of the RdRp, preventing further enzyme translocation and terminating replication at position _i_ + 3. This mechanism was essentially identical between SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV, and genomic comparisons reveal that Ser-861 is conserved across alpha-, beta-, and deltacoronaviruses, suggesting remdesivir may possess broad antiviral activity.[A222398]  Considerations for the use of nucleotide analogues like remdesivir include the possible accumulation of resistance mutations. Excision of analogues through the 3'-5' exonuclease (ExoN) activity of replication complexes, mediated in SARS-CoV by the nsp14 subunit, is of possible concern.[A222398] Murine hepatitis viruses (MHVs) engineered to lack ExoN activity are approximately 4-fold more susceptible to remdesivir, supporting the proposed mechanism of action.[A191400] However, the relatively mild benefit of ExoN activity to remdesivir resistance is proposed to involve its delayed chain termination mechanism, whereby additional endogenous nucleotides are incorporated following RDV-TP.[A222398] In addition, serial passage of MHV in increasing concentrations of the remdesivir parent molecule [GS-441524] led to the development of resistance mutations F476L and V553L, which maintain activity when transferred to SARS-CoV. However, these mutant viruses are less fit than wild-type in both competition assays and _in vivo_ in the absence of selective pressure.[A191400] To date, no clinical data on SARS-CoV-2 resistance to remdesivir have been described.[L18438]",

In controlled trials of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, rates of serum ALT elevations were similar or lower in patients receiving remdesivir than in those on placebo. Nevertheless, in most uncontrolled studies and case series, between 10% and 50% of patients treated with remdesivir developed transient, mild-to-moderate serum ALT and AST elevations within 1 to 5 days of starting therapy without changes in serum bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase levels. Elevations above 5 times ULN were reported in up to 9% of patients in several clinical trials, but the abnormalities resolved with discontinuation and were not associated with clinically apparent injury. With more widespread use of remdesivir for COVID-19, rare instances of marked ALT elevations with jaundice have been reported, but largely in patients who were critically ill with multi-organ failure or sepsis, or who had received other potentially hepatotoxic agents such as intravenous amiodarone (Case 2). Confounding the issue is that serum aminotransferase elevations are common during symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (Case 1), present in up to 60% of patients and being more frequent in patients with severe disease and in those with the known risk factors for COVID-19 severity such as male sex, older age, higher body mass index and diabetes. Thus, serum aminotransferase elevations are common during remdesivir therapy but are generally asymptomatic, fully reversible and not associated with jaundice. With more widespread use of this antiviral in patients without severe or critical illness and with longer courses of therapy, features of hepatotoxicity may become more evident.",
